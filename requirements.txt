# Install: pip install -r requirements.txt
# Note: GPU-accelerated packages may require additional system setup.
# ==========================================================================

# --- Core ---
pyyaml>=6.0
numpy>=1.24
jinja2>=3.1

# --- Stage 2: ASR ---
# Whisper (CTranslate2 backend — faster than openai-whisper)
faster-whisper>=1.0.0

# Speaker diarization (requires HuggingFace token for model access)
# See: https://huggingface.co/pyannote/speaker-diarization-3.1
pyannote.audio>=3.1
torch>=2.1                        # Required by pyannote
